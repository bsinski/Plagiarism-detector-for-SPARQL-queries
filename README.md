# Plagiarism-detector-for-SPARQL-queries

This project aims to detect plagiarism in SPARQL queries. This project is a part of a course called Knowledge Graphs conducted on the Warsaw University of Technology.   It converts SPARQL queries to Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) and than it calulates the distance between two trees using (metric name).

## Scope

The scope of this project is to assess the similarity between two SPARQL queries. This is achieved by first converting SPARQL queries to Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) and than it calulating the distance between them using (metric name).

## AST?
